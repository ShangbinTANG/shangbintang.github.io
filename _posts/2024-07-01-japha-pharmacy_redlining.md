These studies expanded on our earlier work in pharmacy accessibility by examining structural and demographic disparities in access. I stratified the **30% RTI synthetic population sample** by key characteristics such as gender, household income, urbanicity, and **Area Deprivation Index (ADI)**. I also conducted spatial integration of pharmacy access data with historical redlining maps. This analysis supported the teamâ€™s statistical analysis to evaluate the inequities in pharmacy access across racial, socioeconomic, and historically marginalized groups.
