This is an analysis based on our previous <a href = "/portfolio/2-COVID_vaccine_analysis/" target = "_blank">COVID-19 vaccine administration facilities' accessibility evaluation project</a>. Using the information on the racial attributes of people in the  synthetic population sample, as well as their geographic location and network traveling distance to the nearest vaccine facility, the team analyzed the disparity in the accessibility of vaccines for different racial groups.
