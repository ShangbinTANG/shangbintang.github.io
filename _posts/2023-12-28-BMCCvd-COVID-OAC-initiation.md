My other publication from this project: <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.147.suppl_1.P541" target="_blank"> Trends in Initiation of Anticoagulation for Atrial Fibrillation in the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Circulation</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40256-024-00671-3" target="_blank"> COVID-19 Diagnosis, Oral Anticoagulation, and Stroke Risk in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.

This study assessed how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the timely initiation of oral anticoagulants (OAC) among patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.    
    
I built the patient cohort using Optum claims data, selecting individuals based on insurance enrollment, age, chronic conditions, and other clinical criteria. I calculated the time interval between diagnosis and OAC initiation for all eligible patients, providing the basis for the team’s evaluation of treatment delays or disruptions during the early pandemic period. I also conducted **longitudinal follow-up analyses** and constructed individual-level **daily medication and medical event diaries**, and performed **interrupted time series analysis** to assess both clinical outcomes—such as hospitalization, major bleeding, and ischemic stroke—and pharmaceutical outcomes, including switching between warfarin and DOACs, medication adherence, and discontinuation.
