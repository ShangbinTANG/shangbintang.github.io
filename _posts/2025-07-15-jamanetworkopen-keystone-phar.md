Another paper from this project: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0966692324001546?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"> Empirically-derived, locally responsive travel time thresholds for optimal geographic supermarket access using national commuting data. Journal of Transport Geography</a>  
  
These studies extended the concept of “deserts” from food access to healthcare, developing methods to define pharmacy deserts and identify keystone pharmacies—locations whose closure would significantly disrupt local healthcare access.   
  
I geocoded supermarket and grocery store locations from TDLinx and integrated them with U.S. Census Bureau TIGER shapefiles and American Community Survey data. My work supported the spatial modeling of access patterns and the development of localized travel time thresholds for identifying areas with critical vulnerabilities in both food and pharmacy access.
