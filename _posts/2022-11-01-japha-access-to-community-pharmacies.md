This project evaluated accessibility to over **70,000** community pharmacies across the U.S.<br><br>
I modeled individual travel trips and calculated driving distances from households to their nearest pharmacies for more than **100 million** synthetic individuals in the RTI synthetic population dataset, using ArcGIS StreetMap Premium. My responsibilities included managing large-scale geospatial data, developing efficient routing workflows, performing statistical summary analyses, and ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of travel distance estimates for a nationwide accessibility study.
