I led the spatial analysis for this project, modeling service areas based on driving distances for over **61,000** open-door pharmacies nationwide. I performed spatial overlay analysis to identify populations located within the **service areas** of independent, franchise, and chain pharmacies. I also conducted demographic comparisons—by age, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity—to quantify which subgroups had optimal or suboptimal access and determine the pharmacy types they were most geographically reliant on.
