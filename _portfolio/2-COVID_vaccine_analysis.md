In late 2020, we analyzed the accessibility of potential COVID-19 vaccine providers to the general public. We included community pharmacies that provided immunization services as of October 1, 2020, federally qualified health centers, hospital outpatient departments, and rural health clinics as possible vaccine providers. The population sample is a 1% random sample of UTI's synthetic population based on the 2010 census. 

I used ArcGIS to map out the locations of all potential vaccine facilities and synthetic populations, used network analysis to gain the route and network traveling distance (route length) from each sampled synthetic people to their closest facility, processed the result, and summarized it to state and county level. We also performed a subgroup analysis for people with ages equal to or greater than 65.
