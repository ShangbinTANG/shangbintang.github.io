Without any doubt, "Fake News" is absolutely one of the hottest high-frequency words on all kinds of social media, especially in 2020, the year of the COVID-19 outbreak, the U.S. presidential election, and a series of hot social events. We scrapped all 2123 fact-checked news on <a href="https://www.politifact.com/"> PolitiFact.com</a> from January to November, 2020. By analyzing the headlines, authors and platforms/occations of these news, we got some interesting findings.

## Coronavirus, people, president...
We built a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-term_matrix">document term matrix</a> analyze the news title we gathered statistically. The unigrams (one-word sequence) and bigrams (two-word sequence of words) among all collected titles are COVID-19, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, people, president... These hot words reflect the topics that received the most attention from the media and the general public in 2020 (January to November).
